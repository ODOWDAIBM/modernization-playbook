Configure the ORDER database required for the CustomerOrderResource application.
</PageDescription>

This section covers how to deploy a DB2 container to Red Hat OpenShift that has been pre-configured with the ORDER database required for the CustomerOrderResource application.

## Clone a repository (if you haven't already...)
- Issue the following command to clone the repository that contains the required files

```
git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/appmod-liberty-toolkit
```

## Navigate to the DB2 folder
- The `yaml` files for the `Deployment` and `Service` are in the `db2` folder of the repository

```
cd appmod-liberty-toolkit

cd db2
```

## Deploy the DB2 image to OpenShift
- Issue the following commands to create a `namespace`, `service account`, `deploymentconfig` and `service`:

```
oc create ns db2
oc project db2
oc create serviceaccount mysvcacct -n db2
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:db2:mysvcacct
oc apply -f db2-dc.yaml
oc apply -f db2-service.yaml
```

The DB2 database will take a few minutes to start and will then be accessible in the Cluster at `db2.db2.svc:50000`

- If you want to expose the database outside of the cluster, use the `db2-nodeport.yaml` file
