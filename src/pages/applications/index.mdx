<PageDescription>

Modernize your existing application workloads towards a more cloud-native model built on a modern cloud platform.

</PageDescription>

## Overview

Application modernization is a journey of moving existing applications to a more modern cloud-native infrastructure.

A high level overview of key application modernization concepts is available in the [Application Modernization Field Guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/content/field-guide/app-modernization-field-guide/) and the IBM Architecture Center [Application Modernization reference architecture](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/application-modernization/)


## Solutions

Reference implementations for several approaches to application modernization are provided that can be used as starting point when approaching your own implementation.

### Runtime modernization
Updating the application runtime to a suitable cloud-native framework (Liberty) and deploying on Red Hat OpenShift.

This solution shows different deployment options including using modern CI/CD tools (OpenShift Pipelines/Tekton) and using heritage CI/CD tools (Jenkins)

### Operational modernization
* [Operational modernization](was90/README) -- Repackaging the application to deploy within a container but maintaining a monolith application without changes to the application or runtime

### Spring Framework modernization
* [Spring modernization](spring/README) -- Modernizing a legacy Spring application by updating to the latest Spring Boot and deploying in Red Hat OpenShift
